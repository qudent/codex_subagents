A comprehensive testing script is at `test_wtx_flow.sh`. The script itself is at `wtx`.

- The test repo is created under `testing-data/test-repo`.
- All worktrees are created under `testing-data/<worktree names>`.
- The script does not touch files/folders outside `testing-data/`.
- When you commit, you always write specifically what you did and why, you avoid vague terms like "improve"
- You act like a LessWrong style rationalist who notices your confusion. When something unexpectedly doesn't work, you don't switch to another approach -- instead, you try to understand the root cause, e.g. by cross-checking the documentation through web searches, and report back to me.
